    "[Digital Earth Australia (DEA)](https://www.ga.gov.au/dea) is a world-class digital infrastructure that prepares and uses satellite data to detect physical changes across Australia in unprecedented detail. DEA provides government, industry and individuals with the high-quality, analysis-ready data and tools required for policy and investment decision-making. The provision of analysis-ready data removes the requirements for users to correct and manage the petabytes of satellite data available over Australia, providing an API, which allows users to query the available data and extract only the information required. \n",
    "\n",
    "On average, the Australian Government invests around half a billion dollars a year in monitoring, protecting and enhancing Australia's land, coasts and oceans. DEA provides near real-time satellite information which can be used by government to better target these investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Water is among one the most precious natural resources and is essential for the survival of life on Earth. Within Australia, the scarcity of water is both an economic and social issue, particularly across the MDB, where rights to water are heavily contested. Water is required not only for consumption but for industries and environmental ecosystems to function and flourish. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the demand for water increasing, and the variability in rainfall and water storage levels, there is a need to better understand our water availability to ensure we are managing our water resources effectively and efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[DEA's Water Observations from Space (WOfS) dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425715301929), provides a water classified image of Australia approximately every 16 days. Through providing an interpreted product, WOfS makes water information accessible and readily available, removing the need for users to perform this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Waterbody Area Mapping and Monitoring (WAMM) tool, developed by Geoscience Australia's DEA program in collaboration with the NSW Department of Industry Water (NSW DOI Water) and the Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA), is enabling the Australian government to monitor and manage water across the Murray Darling Basin (MDB).\n",
    "\n",
    "This automated tool has mapped over 95,500 water bodies across NSW and the MDB. Each of these water bodies will be monitored on an ongoing basis as new satellite imagery is acquired, providing a vital line of evidence as to the use (and potential misuse) of water across The Basin. This tool will assist in the compliance activities within the MDB, as well as provide information as to the amount, and location of water across Australia at any given point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Waterbody Mapping and Monitoring service further packages up this information, mapping the locations of persistent waterbodies, and collating all available water observations for each mapped waterbody to produce a rich time history of water availability and use across the MDB. "

    "\n",
    "The Waterbody Area Mapping and Monitoring (WAMM) service provides insights into both the location and dynamics of water bodies across Australia. The [Water Observations from Space (WOfS) product](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425715301929) is used to map the locations of water across Australia. The analysis was done on a per pixel basis prior to combining adjoining pixels into polygon objects (i.e. drawing a boundary around them and considering them as a single object rather than a series of individual pixels).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### WOfS temporal statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporal summary statistics were generated using the [datacube-stats](https://github.com/opendatacube/datacube-stats) package, which is a tool for generating large-scale temporal statistics on data within DEA. The parameters used in this calculated are provided [here](WOFSDamDetectionAllTimeNSWMDB.yaml).\n",

    "## Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A [sensitivity analysis](WAMMSensitivityAnalysis.ipynb) was conducted to determine the most suitable analysis date range and wetness thresholds for identifying persistent waterbodies. A compromise was sought between over and under identification of waterbodies, in order to correctly classify waterbodies, while limiting false positives and false negatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pixels were included in this analysis, where during the period from 1987 to 2018, pixels were classified as 'wet' using the WOfS product, at least 10% of the time. A secondary threshold of 5% was used to supplement the spatial footprints of polygons identified using the 10% threshold. \n",
    "The rationale for these parameters are explored in detail in the [sensitivity analysis](WAMMSensitivityAnalysis.ipynb), but are summarised below:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis date range\n",
    "\n",
    "All available observations were included within this analysis (1987 to 2018), with the exception of the most recent months, which were excluded to end the analysis at the end of 2018. During the analysis period, three Landsat satellites were active: Landsat 5 (2000 - 2010), Landsat 7 (2000 - present), and Landsat 8 (2013 - present). Each satellite has a return period of ~16 days. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the 31 year analysis period, across the three satellite platforms, each pixel across Australia was observed clearly, and classified approximately XXXX times (average; min = XXXX, max = XXXX, standard deviation = XXX). Differences in the number of times each pixel was observed was caused by clouds (which meant the observation was not used), \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='wetness'></a>\n",
    "### Wetness threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "The second important parameter using in the generation of the waterbody polygons is the wetness threshold. This threshold determines which pixels are included in the polygon generation, and which are excluded. This threshold needs to be sensitive enough to capture the locations of persistent waterbodies, but not so sensitive as to pick up false positives like flood irrigation, flood events or soggy areas in the landscape. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [sensitivity analysis](WAMMSensitivityAnalysis.ipynb) explored the influence of varying wetness thresholds on the overall results. It was determined that a maximum threshold of 10% was required (pixels were classified as 'wet' using the WOfS product at least 10% of the time between 1987 and 2018). Threshold greater than 10% did not show enough sensitivity to more ephemeral waterbodies, which were a key target of this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "A threshold of 5% proved to be too sensitive, and resulted in a huge increase in the total number of identified polygons, due largely to a very high false positive rate. The 5% threshold did a better job, however, of characterising the spatial footprint of waterbody targets. Where the 10% threshold did a good job of locating waterbodies, the 5% threshold did a better job of charaterising their spatial coverage. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, showing Lake George near the NSW/ACT border, the 10% threshold shown in blue, captures a smaller spatial footprint of Lake George than the 5% threshold in red. Here we can see that the 5% threshold does a better job of capturing the full spatial footprint of Lake George, i.e. the footprint is closer to how we would manually define the outline of Lake George. This creates a nice compromise between better spatial characterisation of footprints, and the addition of false positives from the lower 5% threshold. \n",

    "![Hybrid Threshold effect on Lake George, NSW](HybridThreshold.JPG \"In this example showing Lake George near the NSW/ACT border, the 10% threshold shown in blue, captures a smaller spatial footprint of Lake George than the 5% threshold in red. Here we can see that the 5% threshold does a better job of capturing the full spatial footprint of Lake George\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The area below in south central NSW is an area where flood irrigation is common. The yellow polygons identified below, are those generated from the 5% threshold. The clear presence of 'waterbody' polygons in flood irrigated fields is a good example of the high sensitivity of the 5% threshold, when applied blindly. The hybrid approach (shown in red) shows where the polygons from the 5% threshold have been intentionally selected for inclusion in the final waterbody polygon set. These included polygons intersect with a polygon identified within the 10% threshold, thereby allowing the 10% threshold to identify the location of polygons, but the 5% threshold to characterise their spatial footprint. \n",
