    "\n",
    "Digital Earth Australia (DEA) is a world-class digital infrastructure that prepares and uses satellite data to detect physical changes across Australia in unprecedented detail. DEA provides government, industry and individuals with the high-quality, analysis-ready data and tools required for policy and investment decision-making. The provision of analysis-ready data removes the requirements for users to correct and manage the petabytes of satellite data available over Australia, providing an API, which allows users to query the available data and extract only the information required. \n",
    "\n",
    "On average, the Australian Government invests around half a billion dollars a year in monitoring, protecting and enhancing Australia's land, coasts and oceans. DEA provides near real-time satellite information which can be used by government to better target these investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Water is among one the most precious natural resources and is essential for the survival of life on Earth. Within Australia, the scarcity of water is both an economic and social issue, particularly across the MDB, where rights to water are heavily contested. Water is required not only for consumption but for industries and environmental ecosystems to function and flourish. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the demand for water increasing, and the variability in rainfall and water storage levels, there is a need to better understand our water availability to ensure we are managing our water resources effectively and efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(DEA's Water Observations from Space (WOfS) dataset)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425715301929], provides a water classified image of Australia approximately every 16 days. Through providing an interpreted product, WOfS makes water information accessible and readily available, removing the need for users to perform this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Waterbody Area Mapping and Monitoring (WAMM) tool, developed by Geoscience Australia's DEA program in collaboration with the NSW Department of Industry Water (NSW DOI Water) and the Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA), is enabling the Australian government to monitor and manage water across the Murray Darling Basin (MDB).\n",
    "\n",
    "This automated tool has mapped over 108,000 water bodies across NSW and the MDB. Each of these water bodies will be monitored on an ongoing basis as new satellite imagery is acquired, providing a vital line of evidence as to the use (and potential misuse) of water across The Basin. This tool will assist in the compliance activities within the MDB, as well as provide information as to the amount, and location of water across Australia at any given point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Waterbody Mapping and Monitoring service further packages up this information, mapping the locations of persistent waterbodies, and collating all available water observations for each mapped waterbody to produce a rich time history of water availability and use across the MDB. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Earth Australia in collaboration with the NSW DOI Water, aimed to develop a mapping and monitoring tool that would provide the ability to monitor water bodies in the MDB, in order to;\n",
    "\n",
    "* Develop a large-scale, operational monitoring tool to support the water compliance activities of NSW DOI and the MDBA.\n",
    "* Monitor and focus efforts of compliance on areas that show signs of change.\n",
    "* Provide support for environmental monitoring and conservation projects, including environmental watering activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any tool developed to respond to these needs had to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Process and simplify the full spatial and temporal coverage of satellite data over the Basin into an interpreted product that identifies water;\n",
    "* Be able to see when waterbodies were filling and emptying;\n",
    "* Be able to combine the information above with water licence information; and\n",
    "* Provide a simple user interface.\n",
