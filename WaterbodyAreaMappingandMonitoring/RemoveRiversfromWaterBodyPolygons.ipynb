    "**What does this notebook do?** This notebook applies the `FilterRivers` filter from the `GenerateWaterBodyPolygons.ipynb` notebook. This allows this filtering step to be applied to the final Water Body Polygon dataset, in order to produce a further refined version in which the polygon IDs still match up with the all encompassing version.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required inputs:** \n",
    "* River line dataset for filtering out polygons comprised of river segments.\n",
    "    * Variable name: `MajorRiversDataset`\n",
    "    * Here we use the [Bureau of Meteorology's Geofabric v 3.0.5 Beta (Suface Hydrology Network)](ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/home/geofabric/), filtered to only keep features tagged as `major rivers`. \n",
    "    * There are some identified issues with this data layer that make the filtering using this data inconsistent (see [the discussion below](#rivers))\n",
    "    * We therefore turn this off during the production of the water bodies shapefile.   \n",
