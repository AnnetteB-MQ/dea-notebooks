Waterbody Area Mapping and Monitoring
=====================================

**Please note that this repository and associated documentation is still being developed**

This repository outlines the documentation and discussion for the Waterbody Area Mapping and Monitoring (WAMM) product.

This README will step you through the accompanying documents, and outline how to navigate this folder.

Background

Aims
----
* Develop a large-scale, operational monitoring tool to support the water compliance activities of NSW DOI and the MDBA.
* Monitor and focus efforts of compliance on areas that show signs of change.
* Provide support for environmental monitoring and conservation projects, including environmental watering activities.

Any tool developed to respond to these needs had to: 

* Process and simplify the full spatial and temporal coverage of satellite data over the Basin into an interpreted product that identifies water;
* Be able to see when waterbodies were filling and emptying;
* Be able to combine the information above with water licence information; and
* Provide a simple user interface.
