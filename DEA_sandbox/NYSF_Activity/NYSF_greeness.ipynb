    "## Activity\n",
    "The second half of today's activity is to explore how satellites detect vegetation greenness in the landscape.\n",
    "Your task is to load some satellite data for the recent past over the Geoscience Australia grounds and compare your measurements of NDVI against the satellite data.\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This digital platform that you are using is called a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "It is an environment that allows computer code (Python code in this case) to be written and run.\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is composed of individual cells, which are blocks of text or code.\n",
    "In this tutorial, all of the code has been written for you.\n",
    "Your job is to run each cell to see the results and insert your own data when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a cell in a Jupyter Notebook, place the cursor in the cell and simultaneously, select `shift` and `enter` on the keyboard.\n",
    "When a cell of code is run, the results (if there are any) are output immediately below it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try running the cell below."

    "To complete the activities in this notebook, it is important that you do not change any of the code unless you are specifically instructed to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many coding applications require the importation of modules to maximise the efficiency with which you can complete your coding task.\n",
    "The following cell imports the features required for this notebook to work.\n",
    "Once it has run, there will not be a visible output below the cell.\n",
    "Instead, this section of code loads the required modules into the background of this Jupyter Notebook session.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can determine whether a cell has run by the number in square brackets to the left of the code cells.\n",
    "These numbers represent the order in which cells have been run during this session using the notebook.\n",
    "Once a cell, such as the module import cell below, has been run, it typically will not need to be run again during a session.\n",
