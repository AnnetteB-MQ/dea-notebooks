    "The second half of today's activity is to explore how satellites detect vegetation greenness in the landscape.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "This digital platform that you are using is called a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "It is an environment that allows computer code (Python code in this case) to be written and run.\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is composed of individual cells, which are blocks of text or code.\n",
    "In this tutorial, all of the code has been written for you.\n",
    "Your job is to run each cell to see the results and insert your own data when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a cell in a Jupyter Notebook, place the cursor in the cell and simultaneously, select `shift` and `enter` on the keyboard.\n",
    "When a cell of code is run, the results (if there are any) are output immediately below it.\n",
