    "\n",
    "Understanding how the vegetated landscape responds to longer-term environmental drivers such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or climate change, requires the calculation of seasonal anomalies. Seasonal anomalies subtract the long-term seasonal mean from a time-series, thus removing seasonal variability and highlighting change related to longer-term drivers. "

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will calculate the seasonal anomaly for any given season and year. The long-term seasonal climatologies for the vegetation indices, `MSAVI`, and `NDVI` (NDVI hasn't been run yet), have been pre-calculated and are stored on disk. Given an AOI, season, and year, the script will calculate the seasonal mean for one of these indices and subtract the seasonal mean from the long-term climatology, resulting in a map of vegetation anomalies for your AOI.  Optionally, the script will output a geotiff of the result. \n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTES:** \n",
    "\n",
    "* It is a convention to establish climatologies based on a 30-year time range to account for inter-annual and inter-decadal modes of climate variability (often 1980-2010). As the landsat archive only goes back to 1987, the climatologies here have been calculated using the date-range `Dec 1987 - Feb 2011` (inclusive).  While this is not ideal, a 22-year climatology should suffice to capture the bulk of inter-annual and inter-decadal variability, for example, both a major El Nino (1998) and a major La Nina (2010) are captured by this time-range.\n",
    "* Currently, the pre-computed climatologies are only `MSAVI mean`, the `MSAVI Standard Deviation` has not been pre-computed, hence it is not yet possible to calculate `standardised anomalies`. `NDVI anomalies` have not yet been run.\n",
    "* The pre-computed climatologies do not include LS7 after the SLC failure (2003).\n",
    "* `.yaml` files for running datacube stats to calculate vegetation climatologies are located here: `'/g/data/r78/cb3058/dea-notebooks/vegetation_anomlies/dcstats'`. There is a different .yaml file for each season, and a corresponding custom datacube-statistics python file for each season; these are located here: `'/g/data/r78/datacube_stats/custom_stats'` \n",
    "* The pre-computed climatologies are stored here: `/g/data/r78/cb3058/dea-notebooks/vegetation_anomalies/results`.  The script below will use this string location to grab the data, so shifting the climatology mosaics to another location will require editing the `anomalies.py` script in the `src` folder. \n",
    "* So far, climatolgies have been produced for the `Northern Murray-Darling Basin` for the `SON` and `JJA` seasons; the `DJF` season has a mosaic that is 2/3 complete (59 out of 90 albers tiles). The `NW Queensland` region has mosaicked climatologies for `JJA` and `DJF`, but these are also only 2/3 complete (60 out of 90 albers tiles processed)."
