    "### General advice (delete this cell before submitting for review)\n",
    "\n",
    "> * When choosing a location for your analysis, **select an area that has data on both the NCI and DEA Sandbox** to allow your code to be run on both environments. \n",
    "For example, you can check this for Landsat using the [DEA Explorer](https://explorer.sandbox.dea.ga.gov.au/ga_ls5t_ard_3/1990) (use the drop-down menu to view all products).\n",
    "As of September 2019, the `DEA Sandbox` has a single year of continental Landsat data for 2015-16, and the full 1987-onward time-series for three locations (Perth WA, Brisbane QLD, and western NSW).\n",
    "> * When adding **Products used**, embed the hyperlink to that specific product on the DEA Explorer using the `[product_name](product url)` syntax.\n",
    "> * When writing in Markdown cells, start each sentence on a **new line**.\n",
    "This makes it easy to see changes through git commits.\n",
    "> * Use Australian English in markdown cells and code comments.\n",
    "> * Check the [known issues](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-docs/wiki/Known-issues) for formatting regarding the conversion of notebooks to DEA docs using Sphinx.\n",
    "Things to be aware of:\n",
    "    * Sphinx is highly sensitive to bulleted lists:\n",
    "        * Ensure that there is an empty line between any preceding text and the list\n",
    "        * Only use the `*` bullet (`-` is not recognised)\n",
    "        * Sublists must be indented by 4 spaces\n",
    "    * Two kinds of formatting cannot be used simultaneously:\n",
    "        * Hyperlinked code: \\[\\`code_format\\`](hyperlink) fails\n",
    "        * Bolded code: \\*\\*\\`code_format\\`\\*\\* fails\n",
    "    * Headers must appear in heirachical order (`#`, `##`, `###`, `####`) and there can only be one title (`#`).\n",
    "> * Use the [PEP8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code. To make sure all code in the notebook is consistent, you can use the `jupyterlab_code_formatter` tool: select each code cell, then click `Edit` and then one of the `Apply X Formatter` options (`YAPF` or `Black` are recommended). This will reformat the code in the cell to a consistent style.\n",
    "> * For additional guidance, refer to the style conventions and layouts in approved `develop` branch notebooks. \n",
    "Examples include\n",
    "    * [Frequently_used_code/Using_load_ard.ipynb](./Frequently_used_code/Using_load_ard.ipynb)\n",
    "    * [Real_world_examples/Coastal_erosion.ipynb](./Real_world_examples/Coastal_erosion.ipynb)\n",
    "    * [Scripts/dea_datahandling.py](./Scripts/dea_datahandling.py)\n",
    "> * The DEA Image placed in the title cell will display as long as the notebook is contained in one of the standard directories.\n",
    "It does not work in the highest level directory (hence why it doesn't display in the original template notebook).\n",
    "> * In the final notebook cell, include a set of relevant tags which are used to build the DEA User Guide's [Tag Index](https://docs.dea.ga.gov.au/genindex.html). \n",
    "Use all lower-case (unless the tag is an acronym), separate words with spaces (unless it is the name of an imported module), and [re-use existing tags](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks/wiki/List-of-tags).\n",
    "Ensure the tags cell below is in `Raw` format, rather than `Markdown` or `Code`.\n"
