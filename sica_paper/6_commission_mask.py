"""
Generate commission error mask

Commission masking using per-pixel frequency maps:
-	If normalised frequency (all_time) is <=0.125 (1 in 8 years) == commision error

-	Relax that threshold to account for recent commission errors (whose normalised frequency will look like higher frequency cropping.) If the count is equal to 1 and the normalised frequency is between 0.125 and 0.25, count as commission error.

-	Commission errors occurring for the first time in the last 3 years (since 2016) will be missed by this analysis. Regions converted to irrigation between 2010 and 2015 that were only irrigated once will be erroneously recorded as commission errors. 

-	Regions that were irrigated for a short period of time (low count) at the start of the time-series, but then underwent land use change and were no longer irrigated, will be erroneously removed by the commission masks. Eg. Imagine a paddock first irrigated in 1988 and irrigated for 3 years before ceasing being irrigatedÂ…its normalised frequency will be 3/29=0.103 and thus it will be removed by the commission error mask (set at 0.125)
